# 6.S081-labs

Lab assignments for MIT 6.S081: Operating System Engineering. Each lab is put in its corresponding branch. Course description is quoted from the course 
website https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2020/schedule.html:

Design and implementation of operating systems, and their use as a foundation for systems programming. Topics include virtual memory; 
file systems; threads; context switches; kernels; interrupts; system calls; interprocess communication; coordination, and interaction 
between software and hardware. A multi-processor operating system for RISC-V, xv6, is used to illustrate these topics. Individual laboratory 
assignments involve extending the xv6 operating system, for example to support sophisticated virtual memory features and networking.
